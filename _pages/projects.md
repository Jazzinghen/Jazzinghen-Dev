## Games

### High school projects

High school was a strange time: I had a few friends that were into strange self-made
paper games and they were playing them through lessons or during time off.

I helped them adding new stuff to those games, then I helped testing an implementation
in Visual Basic of one of these games, "Road to Al Capone".

Together we tried to make a survival game based on the real geometry of our school,
creating a converter from CAD models to FBX. I worked more on the game design and on
the story.

Together with one of these friends I made a small, silly, RPGMaker game called "Medievo
2013".

### "Terraforma"

![alt text](/assets/images/Terraforma_Screenshot.jpg "Terraforma Screenshot")

"Terraforma" is a game I made with [Nicolas Silva][1] in Unity3D for the course
"Introduction to Computer Game Prototyping" at Technical University of Denmark. It's a
stealth game with physics-based combat system. The player character cannot attack
directly the enemies and has to either navigate wihout being seen or neutralize the
enemies using her terrain manipulation powers to lower or raise the ground. Features a
dynamic water level system, an enemy area of operations editor for level creation and
2.5D graphics.

### "Bisoux"

![alt text](/assets/images/Bisoux_Photo.jpg "Bisoux Photo")

Project created for the [Games [4Design] Jam][2] at [CHI'13][3] in a team. It's a physical
controller based game that helped people getting accustomed to the way of greeting in
France: each player wore a "pendant", an Arduino board with batteries and a red LED
Matrix, and two "kiss sensors" on their cheeks. The target was to go around the
conference floor to greet people by touching both cheeks. Each time the greeting was
done correctly a big pixel-art heart would fill. The first player to fill the heart was
the winner. I worked on the game design and the implementation of the game.

### "OHR" and "Radiant Square"

![alt text](/assets/images/OHR_Gameplay.jpg "OHR and Radiant Square gameplay")

Game and physical controller prototypes created together with Adriano Siesser, Andrea
Conci, Raul Masu and Zeno Menestrina. "OHR" is a game created to explore different
modalities of play, both classical and tangible, powered by Unity3D and a custom-built
hardware interface called "Radiant Square (Radiant2)". I participated in every phase of
the creation of the project, focusing on game design, interaction with the game artist,
physical prototype design and feeling, paper writing and presentation.

The project won the Jury Prize at the Student Game Competition of [CHI Play 2014][4].

### "City Spirits" and "Magnum Opus"

"City Spirits", and its evolution "Magum Opus", was a research project on long-term
behavioural change through gaming. It involved urban ethnography, user research, focus
groups, and cognitive science research.

Both the games aimed at motivating people to walk more by first providing an external
motivation, while aiming to internalize the motivation by make the players interact with
the world around them.

The game had [strong theory foundations][6], but it was left incomplete once I left the
PhD.

## Research projects

### "Euphrosyne" and "Red Thread of Fate"

![alt text](/assets/images/Euphrosyne_Prototype.jpg "Euphrosyne")

Started as a final Master's project, "Euphrosyne" was a portable emotive status sensor
capable of tracking the pleasure and arousal dimensions of the PAD emotion
classification model, using skin conductivity and heart rate as physiological
indicators. It was using a custom skin conductivity sensor and a basic
photoplethysmograph. It was also my first soldering project ever.

The prototype was then proposed to be used in a sub-project called
[Red Thread of Fate][5].

### "GaitAnimator"

![alt text](/assets/images/GaitAnimator_Architecture.jpg "GaitAnimator Architecture")

"GaitAnimator" was a UE4-based application for body area network research, supporting
custom external data sources. The application was developed during a 2.5 months
visiting researcher period at TokyoTech under the supervision of Prof. Takahiro Aoyagi.

## Tabletop RPGs

### Untitled Exalted 2nd one-shot

Created 5 character concepts and final character sheets for a public Exhalted 2nd
edition one-shot session ran by Michele Graffeo during the "GiocATrento 2010" game
festival.

### "The Rollers"

![alt text](/assets/images/The_Rollers_Flyer.png "The Rollers advertisement flyer")

"The Rollers" was a GURPS 4th edition public one-shot session ran by me during the
"GiocATrento 2011" game festival. I wrote the adventure scenario, the final character
sheets, created the [game materials, and the flyer][7].

### Personal Campaigns

During my life as a tabletop roleplaying player I have participated in countless
campaigns as player character, often helping out other players with character creation
and rules. I learned a lot how to play and how to run campaigns from a large amount of
examples. They are a great way 

I have ran a few homebrew campaigns in different game systems, such as "GURPS 4th",
"Pathfinder", and "Burning Wheel". I have also ran the prebuilt campaigns "Jade Regent",
"Lost Mine of Phandelver" and "Princes of the Apocalypse" (still running as of May
2020).

## Mechanical Keyboards

### "Scarborough Fair"

![alt text](/assets/images/Scarborough_Fair.jpg "Scarborough Fair shot")

My first custom mechanical keyboard, also my first ortholinear keyboard, as well as
my first split keyboard. This was both a blast to make and a tour de force. Due to my
inexperience I had to resolder some switches and the underglow system multiple times
during the months after I soldered it. A big thanks goes to both [Andrew Huie][9] and
[Jeffrey Xiao][10] for their help with this. I was ready to flip tables.

This board allowed me to leave behind the (pretty bad) Cherry MX Greens I liked to start
using the real clicky switches: _the NovelKeys Thick Clicks Box Navies_.

[Here is the build log.][8]

### "Vaporblade"

![alt text](/assets/images/Vaporblade.jpg "Vaporblade shot")

When I saw [MiTo's GMK Laser keyset][12] I knew I wanted it. I didn't quite know where
to put that but I needed something that would allow me to have that Cyberpunk aesthetic.

Once I received the keyset I decided to go for a very simple DZ60 60% keyboard PCB,
however the cases provided by the same company didn't satisfy me so I bought a
KPrepublic 60% case with tempered glass bottom. I really like how it turned out and it
was my home "driver" for more than a year.

[Here is the build log.][11]

### "Jehuty"

![alt text](/assets/images/Jehuty.jpg "Jehuty shot")

Japan is the land of strange custom split keyboards. That's why, when I started feeling
nostalgic for some numbers on the "Scarborough Fair" I decided to go to [Yushakobo][14]
in Akihabara and buy an [ErgoDash by omkbd][15].

It still uses Box navies as switches, but sports an SA greenscreen keycaps set.

[Here is the build log.][13]

### ORBIT

![alt text](/assets/images/POLARIS.jpg "POLARIS shot")

Speaking of Japanese keyboard designers, my current (as of May 2020) driver is an
extremely sturdy, slick looking [Polaris by Ai03][17].

Building this keyboard took some time because I decided to lube all the Durock T1
switches. Thanks to the switches, the build of the case, and the isolation foam, this
keyboard sounds great!

[Here is the build log.][16]

## Other

### "BROFist: Robot Operational Fistbumps"

"BROFist: Robot Operational Fistbumps" was my Bachelor's final project. It was a project
to allow direct connection between a didactical Lego NXT robot running a NXTOSEK-based
server and [SciCosLab][18]. This allowed for graphical system modeling and prototyping
by creating a live bidirectional connection to the robot. It was used in the Master's
course "Laboratory of Embedded Control Systems" for two years in a row (they changed
the hardware platform after that period).

Here are the [project code][19] and the [report sources][20].

### GLSL Raymarcher and Qt Node Compositor

![alt text](/assets/images/GLSL_Raymarcher_Screenshot.png "GLSL Raymarcher screenshot")

A joint project for both "Computer Graphics - Introduction" and "Rendering -
Introduction" courses I attended at Technical University of Denmark. Did it together
with Nicolas Silva, while we both worked on everything, I focused on the raytracer
implementation in OpenGL and GLSL, while he focused in the integration of a node-base
effect editor.

[Here is the source code][21]

### "Project Xeresia" and "600 bucks per second"

Two 50000+ words novels I have written for [NaNoWriMo][22] 2010 and 2011. They are
fantasy/sci-fantasy novels where I tried to write some "shounen-y" stories without
banal characters and character interactions. I don't know if I managed. But I managed
to keep up with the strict deadlines in place during the NaNoWriMo event.

The first one, "Project Xersia", was completed only in theory, as I managed to write
more than 50k words, but in practice the story was far from complete. Learning from this
experience, the next year, I wrote "600 bucks per second", managing not only to write
more than 60k words, but also managing to put the word end to that story.

It was a very exciting experience.

You can find both novels (in Italian) on their [GitHub repo][23].

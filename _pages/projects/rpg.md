## "The Rollers"

![alt text](/assets/images/The_Rollers_Flyer.png "The Rollers advertisement flyer")

"The Rollers" was a GURPS 4th edition public one-shot session ran by me during the
"GiocATrento 2011" game festival. I wrote the adventure scenario, the final character
sheets, created the [game materials, and the flyer][1].

## Untitled Exalted 2nd one-shot

Created 5 character concepts and final character sheets for a public Exhalted 2nd
edition one-shot session ran by Michele Graffeo during the "GiocATrento 2010" game
festival.

## Personal Campaigns

During my life as a tabletop roleplaying player I have participated in countless
campaigns as player character, often helping out other players with character creation
and rules. I learned a lot how to play and how to run campaigns from a large amount of
examples.

I have ran a few homebrew campaigns in different game systems, such as "GURPS 4th",
"Pathfinder", and "Burning Wheel". I have also ran the prebuilt campaigns "Jade Regent",
"Lost Mine of Phandelver" and "Princes of the Apocalypse" (still running as of May
2020).
